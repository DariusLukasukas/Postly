# Project Description

Welcome to Postly Github repository, where I've built a microblogging platform reminiscent of Twitter, but with a unique spin. While platform doesn't yet encompass all the features of Twitter, it certainly aspires to!

In the current version, users are equipped with several functions:

- Creating and deleting posts.
- Registering as a new user.
- Modifying their user profile, which includes changes to the name, bio, username, and cover image.

This platform serves as a great learning experience, and through its evolution, I intend to incorporate the following features:

- [x] **Authentication system:** To ensure user safety and privacy, we'll be introducing a secure sign-in system.
- [ ] **Notification system:** Users will be notified about the interactions they receive, keeping them connected and informed.
- [x] **Image Upload using Base64 strings:** We'll implement a method for users to express themselves more fully through images.
- [x] **Prisma ORM with MongoDB:** To manage our database, we'll be using Prisma ORM in combination with MongoDB.
- [x] **Responsive Layout:** A user-friendly interface that adapts smoothly to any device or screen size.
- [ ] **1 To Many Relations (User - Post):** Each user will be able to create multiple posts, facilitating an engaging content experience.
- [ ] **Many To Many Relations (Post - Comment):** Each post can host multiple comments, and a single comment can refer to multiple posts, fostering a dynamic conversation environment.
- [x] **Following functionality:** Users will have the ability to follow others, cultivating a personalized content feed.
- [ ] **Comments / Replies:** Users can interact with posts via comments or replies, promoting a lively dialogue.
- [ ] **Likes functionality:** To provide instant feedback, users can 'like' posts and comments.
- [ ] **Vercel Deployment:** The platform will be hosted on Vercel for easy access and enhanced user experience.

Stay tuned for these upcoming features as I continue developing this exciting project!
